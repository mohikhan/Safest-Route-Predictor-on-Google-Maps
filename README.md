# Safest Route Predictor on Google Maps
I made this project with [Gauhar Ayub Khan](https://github.com/gauharayub) and [Syed Kamran](https://github.com/skamranahmed) at Hackfest 2019 hackathon held at IIT Dhanbad. This projects shows the safest route among two locations on google maps using machine learning. We have also integrated Twilio API to use the software as a whatsapp number.
